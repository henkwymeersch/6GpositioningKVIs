6G Positioning and Sensing Through the Lens of Sustainability, Inclusiveness, and Trustworthiness

The code provided here generates the results from Fig. 3 in the corresponding paper. 

## Usage
Run the main.m file in a recent matlab version. The code relies on the two additional files, one to compute the position error bound (PEB) and one to compute the 2D protection level. 

## Associated paper
The code is associated with the paper "6G Positioning and Sensing Through the Lens of Sustainability, Inclusiveness, and Trustworthiness" by H. Wymeersch *et al*, IEEE Wireless Communication Magazine, 2025.
